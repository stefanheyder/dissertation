In applications, e.g. the model studied in \Cref{cha:analysis_of_selected_models}, we are interested in the performance of the importance sampling proposals generated by the \gls{la}, \gls{cem} and \gls{eis} under more complex circumstances than those discussed in \Cref{ex:univ-gaussian-mu-fixed,ex:univ-gaussian-s2-fixed}. In particular, the dimension of $\psi$ is high ($\mathcal O(n \cdot m)$ or even $\mathcal O(n \cdot m^{2})$) and proposals may not come from a natural exponential family, so analysis based on \Cref{thm:cem-clt,thm:eis-clt} is not possible. \todo{really?} Instead, we resort to simulation studies to gain insights into the circumstances when one should prefer one method over the other.
As a leading example, we will use the following vector-autoregressive state space model with negative binomial observations. A similar, though more involved, model is studied in \Cref{sec:regional_growth_factor_model} with real data.

\begin{example}[Negative Binomial $\operatorname{VAR}(1)$ \gls{ssm}]
    \label{ex:negbinom-ar1}
    % setup 
    In this example, we consider a \gls{ssm} where states $X_{t}$ follow a stationary Gaussian $\operatorname{VAR}(1)$ process, initialized in its stationary distribution $\mathcal N(0,\Sigma)$ for \acrshort{spd} $\Sigma$. For simplicity let the transition matrices be given by a multiple of the identity, i.e. $A_{t} = \alpha I_{m}$ for all $t$ where $\alpha \in (-1, 1)$ \todo{add I to symbols}. 
    In total, the states are governed by
    \begin{align*}
    X_{0} &\sim \mathcal N(0,\Sigma) \\
    X_{t} &= \alpha X_{t - 1} + \varepsilon_{t}\\
    \varepsilon_t &\iid \mathcal N(0, (1 - \alpha^{2})\Sigma), t = 1, \dots, n
    \end{align*}
    where the $\varepsilon_{1}, \dots, n$ and $X_{0}$ are jointly independent. The observations follow a conditional negative binomial distribution 
    $$
    Y^{i}_{t} | X_{t} \sim \nbinom \left( \exp(X^{i}_{t}), r \right), \phantom{and} i = 1, \dots, p \phantom{and} t = 0, \dots, n
    $$
    and individual observations are conditionally independent given the current state. The parametrization of the negative binomial distribution $\nbinom \left( \mu, r \right)$ is such that the density is
    $$
        p_{\mu, r}(y) = \binom{y + r - 1}{r} \left( \frac{\mu}{r + \mu} \right)^{y} \left( \frac{r}{r + \mu} \right)^{r} \propto \mu^{y} (\mu + r)^{-(r + y)},
    $$
    where proportionality is in $\mu$, with expectation $\mu$, variance $\mu + \frac{\mu^{2}}{r}$ and support $\N_{0}$. 
\end{example}

%% simulation study on MSE/Bias/Variance

Our first simulation study concerns the non-asymptotic behavior of the \gls{cem} and \gls{eis} estimators, i.e. finite sample analogs of \Cref{thm:cem-clt,thm:eis-clt}. To this end,
we let $m = 1$ in \Cref{ex:negbinom-ar1}, fix $n$ to $100$ and set $\Sigma = \sigma^{2} = 1$. 
We then simulate once from the marginal distribution of $Y$ and perform the \gls{la} to a prespecified precision $\epsilon$ and maximum number of iterations $n_{\text{iter}}$, obtaining a proposal distribution $\G_{\la}$. Using a large number of samples $N_{\text{true}}$ from this proposal we find the optimal $\G_{\ce}$ and $\G_{\eis}$ using the same desired precision and number of iterations as for the \gls{la}. For the remainder of this section, we ignore sampling variation in these proposals and treat them as exact. 

%% posterior marginal means and variances
To determine the non-asymptotic sampling behavior we now perform the above procedure again, using only $N \ll N_{\text{true}}$ many samples for both procedures, obtaining proposals $\hat\P^{N}_{\ce}$ and $\hat \P^{N}_{\eis}$. The full proposals are Gaussian distributions on $\R^{(n+1)\times m}$, either given as the posterior of a \gls{glssm} (\gls{la}, \gls{eis}) or by a Gaussian Markov process(\gls{cem}), see \Cref{sec:gaussian_importance_sampling_for_state_space_models}. 
This procedure is repeated $M$ times for every sample size $N$ considered, with different initial random seeds, obtaining $\hat\P^{N,i}_{\ce}$ and $\hat \P^{N,i}_{\eis}$ for $i = 1, \dots, M$.

To assess the speed of convergence of the \gls{cem} and \gls{eis} we then estimate the mean squared error of means and variances of the $(n+1) \times m$ univariate marginals as $N$, the number of samples used to obtain $\hpce$ or $\hpeis$, grows. For the true value, we take the univariate means and variances of $\G_{\ce}$ and $\G_{\eis}$ respectively. Additionally, we perform a bias-variance decomposition to see where the estimation error originates. 

More concretely, fix $N$ and denote by $\mu, \sigma^{2} \in \mathbf R^{(n + 1) \cdot m}$ the marginal means and variances of $\G_{\ce}$ ($\G_{\eis}$). 
Let $\hat\mu_{i}, \hat\sigma^{2}_{i}\in\mathbf R^{(n + 1) \cdot m}$ be the marginal means and variances of $\G^{N,i}_{\ce}$ ($\G^{N,i}_{\eis}$) for $i = 1,\dots, M$. 
Now 
$$
\widehat{\text{aMSE}} = \frac{1}{M} \frac{1}{(n + 1)m} \sum_{i = 1}^M \lVert \mu - \hat\mu_{i} \rVert_{2}^2 + \lVert \sigma^{2} - \hat\sigma_{i}^2 \rVert^{2}_{2}
$$
is an estimate of the mean-squared error of $(\mu, \sigma^{2})$, where we divide by $(n+1)m$ to make estimates comparable across models of different dimensions. 

%The $\text{ASE}_{i}$ is of interest to the practitioner as they usually only run a single iteration of the optimal importance sampling procedure. So while a low $\text{AMSE}$ is desirable, the variance of $\text{ASE}$ should also be small in practice, as otherwise several runs of the optimal importance sampling procedure may be required to obtain a good proposal.

In \Cref{fig:mse_bias_var_decomposition} we show the $\widehat{\text{aMSE}}$ for both the \gls{cem} and \gls{eis} for varying values of $N$. As is evident from this Figure, the \gls{cem} consistently has a larger aMSE than \gls{eis}, for all values of $N$. Thus the \gls{cem} requires several orders of magnitude more samples to obtain the same precision as \gls{eis}.

For further investigation, we perform a bias-variance decomposition of the aMSE for both the means $\mu$ and variances $\sigma^{2}$. Consider the average means and variances over the $M$ simulations,
\begin{align*}
    \bar \mu = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^{M} \hat\mu_{i} && \bar \sigma^{2} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^{M} \hat\sigma^{2}_{i},
\end{align*}
and the state-average squared bias and variance
\begin{align*}
    \text{aBias}^{2}_{\mu} &= \frac{1}{(n+1)m} \lVert \mu - \bar\mu \rVert^{2}_{2}, \\
    \text{aVar}_{\mu} &= \frac{1}{M - 1}\frac{1}{(n+1)m} \sum_{i=1}^M \lVert \bar\mu - \mu_{i} \rVert^{2}_{2},\\
    \text{aBias}^{2}_{\sigma^{2}} &= \frac{1}{(n+1)m} \lVert \sigma^{2} - \bar\sigma^{2} \rVert^{2}_{2}, \\
    \text{aVar}_{\sigma^{2}} &= \frac{1}{M - 1}\frac{1}{(n+1)m} \sum_{i=1}^M \lVert \bar\sigma^{2} - \sigma^{2}_{i} \rVert^{2}_{2}.
\end{align*}
These values are depicted in \Cref{fig:mse_bias_var_decomposition}.

% fig:mse_bias_var_decomposition
In \Cref{fig:mse_bias_var_decomposition} we see that the average MSE is much smaller for \acrshort{eis} compared to the 
\todo{interpretation of \Cref{fig:mse_bias_var_decomposition}, equal contribution of bias and var, not much to gain from bias correction}
\todo{is bias of CEM really of this order? would expect bias usually to be of order 1/n, bias squared of order 1/n squared, so negligible compared to 1/n mse?}
