The Poisson distribution arises from the law of small numbers: if there is a large population where every individual has, independently, a small probability of becoming infected in a small window of time then the total number of infections in that window of time is well approximated by the Poisson distribution.
Indeed, the law of small numbers remains valid for small dependencies \citep{Ross2011Fundamentalsa,Arratia1990Poisson}.
However, incidences observed from the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic tend to follow a negative binomial distribution \citep{Chan2021Count}.
