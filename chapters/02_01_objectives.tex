\section{Objectives of epidemiological modelling}



\paragraph{Monitoring}
%monitoring is real-time scenario, interested in current developments, i.e. recent past and near future. complicated by potentially slow reporting, data revisions
%informs decision makers on whether measures should be taken
%ForecastHub(s) provide platform that creates ensemble forecast to obtain better predictions \cite{Bracher2022National,Bracher2021Preregistered,Ray2020Ensemble,Sherratt2022Predictive}

\paragraph{Retrospective Analysis}
%evaluation of measures taken, want interpretation as causal as possible
%informs decision makes on which measures were effective and how much
%difficult due to usual reasons: poor data quality, observational data, causual structure difficult, early/late adoption makes timing of measurements difficult
%cite some papers that did this \cite{Flaxman2020Estimating,Brauner2021Inferring,Khazaei2023Using}

\paragraph{Scenario Modelling}

%concerns itself with modelling the impact that variants, seasonality etc. have in specific scenarios 
%find out whether there is already paper of ECDC to cite
