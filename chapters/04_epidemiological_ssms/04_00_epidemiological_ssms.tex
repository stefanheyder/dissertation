\begin{tcolorbox}[title={Contributions of this chapter}]
    The main contribution of this chapter is to apply the methods derived in \Cref{cha:state_space_models} to selected inference and prediction problems in the context of \acrshort{c19} in Germany. Each model is an extension of model we have used during the \acrshort{c19} pandemic to produce forecasts of cases, deaths and hospitalizations. As all content of this chapter is newly contributed, we give a short overview over the improvements that these models contribute.

    \paragraph{\nameref{sec:model_reporting_delay}}
    The model developed in this section is based on the \texttt{ILM-EKF} model that Thomas Hotz and the author have submitted to the ECDCs COVID-19 ForecastHub. The original model was also based on a \acrshort{ssm}, however fit with an extended Kalman-filter, ignoring the integer nature of the data at hand. This model also did not include delays and was based on reproduction numbers.

    \paragraph{\nameref{sec:regional_growth_factor_model}}
    This model is based on the \texttt{ITWW-county\_repro} model that Thomas Hotz, Tyll Kr√ºger, Jan Pablo Burgard, Przemyslaw Biecek, Viktor Bezborodov, Marcin Bodych and the author have submitted to both the German-Polish COVID-19 ForecastHub and the ECDC's ForecastHub. This model was not based on a \acrshort{ssm}, but rather ignored the dependencies over time. Additionally, it was based on reproduction numbers, which were fit to the incidence data using methods from small-area estimation. The main idea for this model is available in \citep{Heyder2022Regional}.

    \paragraph{\nameref{sec:nowcasting_hospitalizations}}
    The model designed in this section is based on the \texttt{ILM-prop} model that Thomas Hotz and the author submitted to the German NowcastHub. Again, this model was note based on a \acrshort{ssm}. It quantified the uncertainty by past performance, which requires a substantial amount of computation - something that the model presented in this section avoids.

Having established the practical advantages of \acrshort{eis} over the \acrshort{cem} in the previous chapter, we now demonstrate the usefulness of \acrshortpl{ssm} for epidemiological modeling. We present three applications: accounting for reporting artifacts (\Cref{sec:model_reporting_delay}), modeling regional effects (\Cref{sec:regional_growth_factor_model}), and performing fore- and nowcasting (\Cref{sec:nowcasting_hospitalizations}). These applications illustrate how \acrshortpl{ssm} provide a flexible modeling framework that allows practitioners to tailor interpretable models to specific research questions.

The models we present in this chapter are not based on compartmental models, but rather on the epidemiological indicators presented in \Cref{sec:measures_of_epidemic_spread}. We prefer these methods, as the compartmental models require their users to make a lot of assumptions regarding the dynamics of the epidemics, e.g. whether reinfections can or cannot occur, whether population size is fixed or not and also distributional assumptions for the transition rates between compartments. 
Such assumptions are difficult to verify in practice, and the influence of deviation from them is too. Basing, the infection dynamics solely on the exponential growth factor only assumes that cases grow exponentially, which is theoretically and empirically justified. 
Additionally, the parameters in compartmental models may be harder to interpret, compared to, e.g., the exponential growth factor; see \Cref{subsec:usefulness_of_indicators}.

Before we present our results, we give a short overview over similar work, in particular those that leverage \acrshortpl{ssm} to perform inference or short-term predictions for \acrshort{c19}.

One prominent approach involves modeling disease dynamics with growth factors. \citep{Arroyo-Marioli2021Tracking} develop a local level model for the log-growth factor based on a classical SIR model, which allows them to derive reproduction numbers. Their model is fully Gaussian and can be fitted using the Kalman smoother. Similarly, \citep{Ives2021Estimating} present a similar local level model for the log-growth factor, but assume observations to follow a quasi-Poisson distribution, modeling the growth of deaths instead of the reported cases. Their model is fitted using the extended Kalman filter for US counties.

An alternative strategy derives state space models directly from epidemiological theory. \citep{Lal2021Application} and \citep{Keller2022Tracking} derive \acrshortpl{ssm} from a time-discretized version of ODE-based compartmental models. In this framework, \citep{Lal2021Application} assume conditionally Gaussian observations, but the dependence between states and observations is non-linear, so the \acrshort{enkf} was used to fit the model. Taking a fully Bayesian perspective, \citep{Keller2022Tracking} use a negative binomial distribution for cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. They adopt a fully Bayesian view putting priors on hyperparameters and derive posterior distributions of interest by Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo.

The third approach leverages asymptotic theory for computational efficiency. \citep{ODea2022Semiparametric} for example implement this approach, exploiting a \acrshort{clt} for compartmental models, to obtain a Gaussian approximation to the states' dynamics. The model can then be fitted using the \acrshort{ekf}.

From this overview, we see that most existing \acrshortpl{ssm} rely on compartmental models to represent epidemic dynamics. In contrast, the models we present in this section provide an alternative approach based on epidemiological indicators rather than compartmental structures. This offers practitioners simpler, more interpretable models with fewer assumptions about disease dynamics, providing greater flexibility when addressing specific research questions.

Unless noted otherwise, all computations are performed on a Macbook Air M3 (2024) with 16GB RAM and are fitted in less than one hour of computation time. \todo{check that this is true} An exception is the larger model in \Cref{sec:regional_growth_factor_model}, see there for details on runtime.
