Equipped with the theoretical insight into the practical advantages that \acrshort{eis} has over the \acrshort{cem}, we are prepared to demonstrate the usefulness of \acrshortpl{ssm} for epidemiological modeling. To this end, we will present three applications where modeling with \acrshortpl{ssm} is useful: accounting for reporting artifacts (\Cref{sec:model_reporting_delay}) and regional effects (\Cref{sec:regional_growth_factor_model}), as well as fore- and nowcasting (\Cref{sec:nowcasting_hospitalizations}). In laying out the rationales for each of the models it will become clear that \acrshortpl{ssm} provide a flexible modeling framework that allows practitioners to tailor interpretable models to the question at hand. 

The models we present in this chapter are not based on compartmental models, but rather on the epidemiological indicators presented in \Cref{sec:measures_of_epidemic_spread}. We prefer these methods, as the compartmental models require their users to make a lot of assumptions regarding the dynamics of the epidemics, e.g. whether reinfections can or cannot occur, whether population size is fixed or not and also distributional assumptions for the rate of transitions between compartments. 
Such assumptions are hard to verify in practice and the influence of deviation from them is hard to quantify. Basing, the infection dynamics solely on the exponential growth factor only assumes that cases grow exponentially, which is theoretically and empirically straightforward to justify. 
Additionally, the parameters in compartmental models may be harder to interpret, compared to, e.g., the exponential growth factor, see \Cref{subsec:usefulness_of_indicators}.

Before we present our results, we give a short overview over similar work, in particular those that leverage \acrshortpl{ssm} to perform inference or short-term predictions for \acrshort{c19}. 

One prominent approach involves modeling disease dynamics through growth factors. \citep{Arroyo-Marioli2021Tracking} develop a local level model for the log-growth factor based on a classical SIR-model, which allows them to derive reproduction numbers. Their model is fully Gaussian and can be fit using the Kalman smoother. Similarly, \citep{Ives2021Estimating} present a similar local level model for the log-growth factor, but assume observations to follow a quasi-Poisson distribution, modeling the growth of deaths instead of reported cases. Their model is fit using the extended Kalman filter for the counties in the US.

An alternative strategy derives state space models directly from epidemiological theory. \citep{Lal2021Application} and \citep{Keller2022Tracking} derive \acrshortpl{ssm} from a time-discretized version of ODE-based compartmental models. In this framework, \citep{Lal2021Application} assume conditionally Gaussian observations, but the dependence between states and observations is non-linear, so they use the \acrshort{enkf} to fit the model. Taking a fully Bayesian perspective, \citep{Keller2022Tracking} use a negative binomial distribution for cases, hospitalizations and deaths. They adopt a fully Bayesian view putting priors on hyperparameters and derive posterior distributions of interest by Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo.

A third approach leverages asymptotic theory for computational efficiency. \citep{ODea2022Semiparametric} for example implement this approach, exploiting a \acrshort{clt} for compartmental models, to obtain a Gaussian approximation to the states' dynamics. The model can then be fit using the \acrshort{ekf}.

From this overview we see that many of the \acrshortpl{ssm} use compartmental models to model the epidemics' dynamics --- thus the models we present in this section provide an alternative way of modeling infectious disease data with simpler, interpretable models, giving practitioners more flexibility when choosing models to address their research questions.
