\section{Spatial reproduction number model}%
\label{sec:spatial_reproduction_number_model}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item essentially the Regional model presented in ECMI
    \item rationale: compare to weekly GF which has "stable" regional effects
\end{enumerate}

This section is based on \citep{Burgard2021Regional} where we fitted a similar model to daily \acrshort{c19} incidences in Germany. However, in this previous work, we fitted a separate model for each day whereas the model presented in this section additionally regularizes in time by extending the old model to a \acrshort{pgssm}.

\subsection{Model}
Recall from \Cref{sec:measures_of_epidemic_spread} the stochastic renewal equation \todo{ref it} 
$$
    I_{t} | I_{t - 1}, \dots \sim \operatorname{Pois} \left( R_{t} \sum_{\tau = 1}^k I_{t - \tau}w_{\tau}\right)
$$
for the incidences at day $t$ $I_{t}$, the time-varying reproduction number $R_{t}$ and the infectivity profile $w \in \R^{k}_{\geq 0}$ with $\sum_{\tau = 1}^{k} w_{\tau} = 1$.
