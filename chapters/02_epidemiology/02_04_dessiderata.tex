\section{Desiderata for epidemiological models}
\label{sec:dessiderata}

In what follows, we provide give a non-exhaustive list of requirements we have identified as important when modeling the \acrshort{c19} epidemic. To begin, we present a na\"{i}ve analysis of reproduction numbers and weekly growth factors for the  German data to illustrate where this simple approach breaks down. This will be our starting point to motivate which effects to include in our modeling considerations.

For the reproduction number, we first estimate $\hat R$ by the moment estimator \eqref{eq:hatR} using the raw incidences $I_{t}$ for the whole of Germany and the generation time distribution from \Cref{fig:generation_time}. As these estimates are affected by the weekday effect present in the raw incidences, we repeat the estimation, now based on the seven-day averages $\frac{1}{7}\sum_{\tau = -3}^3I_{t - \tau}$, producing smoother estimates. 
Similarly, we estimate the weekly growth factor once by the raw incidences, $ \hat \rho^{7} = \frac{I_{t}}{I_{t - 7}}$ and the smoothed estimate \Cref{eq:rho7_smooth}.

    \label{fig:rho_and_R_naive}
\end{figure}

The results of these procedures are displayed in \Cref{fig:rho_and_R_naive}, and from this figure, we can deduce the shortcomings of this na\"{i}ve analysis. When considering the estimates based on daily incidences, the weekday effect is very noticeable in the reproduction number estimates, which makes interpretation of these estimates on any given day difficult. The growth factor estimates are affected less, because the seven-day period coincides with that of the weekday effect. However, the growth factor estimates are prone to large variances in periods of few incidences, e.g. in the summer of 2020. All estimators are, naturally, susceptible to reporting artifacts, e.g. in the Christmas period already highlighted in \Cref{fig:cases_germany}.

In addition, we want to draw the reader's attention to the local outbreak highlighted already in \Cref{fig:cases_germany}. In this period, a large share of the country-wide cases were reported in a single, small, region, Gütersloh county. If we want to interpret the reproduction number and growth factor estimates as representing the speed of the epidemic at the country level, the estimates corresponding to these dates are exaggerated: we would not expect the number of cases, on the country level, to grow at the same speed as in this single county. Furthermore, the estimates in the weeks following the outbreak are understated, because the outbreak now contributes towards the denominator in the estimates of $R$ and $\rho$. 

More problems arise when we consider inferences based on these estimators. While confidence intervals for the reproduction numbers can be obtained by assuming a Poisson distribution, \Cref{eq:renewal-model}, these confidence intervals apply only to the marginal distribution of a single estimate. Constructing joint confidence intervals for, e.g., the difference in reproduction numbers is not feasible, as the dependencies given by the renewal equation model, \eqref{eq:renewal-model}, are non-linear and non-Gaussian. While applying the estimators to the weekly average of cases does produce smoother estimates, it also introduces bias. Indeed, the renewal equation model is no longer valid for these incidences, as $\frac{1}{7}\sum_{\tau = -3}^3 I_{t + \tau}$ is not independent of the past incidences $\frac{1}7 \sum_{\tau = -3 }^3 I_{t - s +\tau}$ if $t - s < 7$. 


Given these difficulties, we cannot expect precise inferences using such simple models. Instead, we will need to extend these models to account for, depending on the problem considered, some of the following phenomena, depending on the problem at hand. For each of the phenomena we will provide a brief rationale on its importance and offer some ideas on how we could include them in our models. 

\paragraph{regularization in time}
% why 
We would generally expect the day-to-day variation in contact, and thus infection, behavior to be small. Even if new \acrshortpl{npi} are introduced, a mix of early and late adoption in different regions should lead to only small changes in $R$ and $\rho$ each day on the country level. 

% how to do it
To achieve this smoothing, we may model the absolute or relative change in the indicators to be locally linear or constant. 

\paragraph{weekday effects}
% why important
Related to the previous point, weekday effects are a major obstacle in our way to obtain smooth estimates of $R$ and $\rho$ over time. These effects are due to the reporting process, where infections are more likely to be reported during the week than on the weekend. 

% how to do it
While smoothing seems to remove weekday effects visually, the above analysis shows that for reproduction number estimation, smoothing is not suited to properly account for weekday variation in reporting. The reason for this is that the weekday effect can be thought of as the result of a discrete-time convolution of reported infections and a delay distribution that is different for each day of the week. Instead of smoothing, one should solve the inverse problem related to this convolution instead, i.e. perform a deconvolution. 

\paragraph{reporting artifacts}
% why important
%% first incidences too low, then too high
During periods of low attendance at the local health authorities, e.g. due to holiday breaks, fewer cases are reported. This is visible, e.g., during the Christmas break in 2020, see \Cref{fig:cases_germany}. However, people are still infected and as such a backlog of accumulates. Once the break is over, case numbers suddenly start to increase. As a result, the indicators we study first point towards declining, then increasing cases, stabilizing again after the backlog of late reported cases disappears from the denominators of $\hat R$ and $\hat \rho$. 

% how to do it
To deal with this unsatisfactory behavior, we can mark the number of cases in the offending period as missing. This will allow the fitting procedure to rearrange cases in this period so as to best fit the data. If necessary, the total number of missing cases be fixed at the true number of cases in that period, a linear constraint that is easily enforced, see \Cref{sec:modelling_epidemiological_dessiderata_with_state_space_models}.

%The following three aspects are related to modeling the epidemic on a smaller scale. 

\paragraph{regional variation}
The outbreak in Gütersloh county, June 2020, shows what can go wrong if we neglect regional variation of the spread of \acrshort{c19}. Similar to the effect of reporting artifacts, reproduction number and growth factor estimates are  not representative during and shortly after the outbreak. Additionally, we would expect the spread of \acrshort{c19} to be heterogeneous due to other factors as well: different regions possess different levels of immunity, be it by infection or vaccination, implement different \acrshortpl{npi} and, arguably, exhibit different contact behavior: inhabitants of rural counties will probably commute to work by car, while inhabitations of larger cities use public transportation, exposing them to many more infectors. Furthermore, inhabitants can travel between different regions, so our models should include an exchange of infections as well. 

% how to do it
Deterministically modeling different reproduction numbers / growth factors for each of the 400 counties in Germany will be a difficult task, as the number of cases within each region can be quite low, especially between waves, so uncertainty in estimates will be high. Instead, we will implement an idea from small-area estimation, modeling for each day the indicator in a region as random with common marginals. Similar to mixed effects models, this allows regions with few incidences to \glqq{}borrow statistical strength\grqq{} from regions with large incidences. For fixed time-points, we have already implemented such a model in \citep{Burgard2021Regional}. Actually, restricting ourselves to the same marginals is not necessary, as we will see in \Cref{sec:regional_growth_factor_model}. 

% regional dependencies
% travel between regions leads to correlated indicators, i.e. if region with high contact behavior spills over to other region, creating more cases than expected
% argue that his approximation is o.k., otherwise could also have 
% want stability over time
\paragraph{exchange of cases between regions}
% why
%% breakdown of renewal equation
%% very high estimates in periods of high incidence otherwise

% how to do it
To include exchanged cases between regions in our models, 

% use data to inform this section

\begin{itemize}
    \item German case data are reported on Landkreis level, performing analysis of each individual is not sensible 
    \item inhabitants travel between regions, and measures were taken on on regional level as well
    \item effects are not really spatial: euclidean distance is not so much of an issue but how closely connected regions are (give some examples)
    \item also want to account for other regional effects such as different socio-economic settings ... 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{count data}

\todo{this paragraph to modelling chapter}
The Poisson distribution arises from the law of small numbers: if there is a large population where every individual has, independently, a small probability of becoming infected in a small window of time then the total number of infections in that window of time is well approximated by the Poisson distribution.
Indeed, the law of small numbers remains valid for small dependencies \citep{Ross2011Fundamentalsa,Arratia1990Poisson}.
However, incidences observed from the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic tend to follow a negative binomial distribution \citep{Chan2021Count}.
