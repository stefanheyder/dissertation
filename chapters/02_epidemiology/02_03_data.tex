\section{Available data and its quality}
\label{sec:data}

Early during the \acrshort{c19} epidemic, a surprising amount of publicly accessible data on the severity became available quickly. This data was provided by national health authorities such as the \acrfull{rki} in Germany, and was also made available through aggregate data repositories, e.g. by the \acrfull{jhu} \citep{Dong2020Interactive}. These data contains information about the number of cases and deaths reported each day and, depending on the data source, further information, e.g., the age, sex, or location of the case may be included.
%data is a collective noun: 
%    Collective nouns, like team, family, class, group, and host, take a singular verb when the entity acts together and a plural verb when the individuals composing the entity act individually.

The main type of data we use for the models in \Cref{cha:analysis_of_selected_models} consists of case and hospitalization data. In the following, we will present some peculiarities of these data, given by descriptive statistics and explorative data analyses. Based on the findings in this section, the next section, \Cref{sec:dessiderata} will derive desiderata for estimating the indicators introduced in the last section \Cref{sec:measures_of_epidemic_spread}.

Let us note that several other data could be of interest as well, depending on the epidemiological question at hand. Useful data include the DIVI-Intensivregister data monitoring the ICU occupancy and capacity in Germany as well as data on the number of tests and vaccines administered. In our later analysis, we will also make use of other, non-epidemiological, data, e.g. commuting data. As these are not directly related to the epidemic data, we present them separately in the respective sections.

%\subsection{Epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19}
To estimate reproduction numbers by \Cref{eq:hatR} we need to assume a discrete time generation time distribution. Here we use a trapezoidal shape with mean generation time $\bar w = 5.6$ days, used also in \citep{Burgard2021Regional}. Its shape is motivated by the fact that primary cases take some days to become infectious themselves, i.e. the incubation period is several days. Additionally, we deem infection after 11 days unlikely, as symptomatic individuals are most likely quarantined or hospitalized after this time. We display this generation time distribution in \Cref{fig:generation_time}. Note that the generation time distribution varies across variants \citep{Hart2022Generationa}, and should thus be adapted in periods when newer variants become dominant. However, the main focus of this thesis lies in the estimation of growth factors, which are not affected by this, and so we stick to the generation time distribution given in \Cref{fig:generation_time}.

\subsection{Incidence and death data}
In this thesis, we focus on the data available for Germany, provided by the \acrshort{rki} available on Zenodo \citep{RobertKoch-Institut2024SARSCoV2} or GitHub \citep{RobertKoch-Institut2024SARSCoV2a}. In these repositories, the \acrshort{rki} publishes daily data on the number of cases in the aforementioned strata. On days, data has not been published to Zenodo or GitHub, e.g. for May 31st, 2020. In this case, we use the data provided by the ard-data RKI-archive on GitHub \citep{MichaelKreil2022RKICoronaDatenArchiv}. 

This data contains the following information for each case and death:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the county (Landkreis) of the case,
    \item sex (male, female or unknown), and age group (00-04, 05-14, 15-34, 35-59, 60-79, 80+, unknown),
    \item the dates of reporting (Meldedatum) and symptom onset (Refdatum), as well as
    \item meta-information on whether the case was already present in the past dataset.
\end{itemize}

The dates of reporting and symptom onset are of particular importance: the date of reporting is the date that the local health authorities become aware of the case, which may be several days after the symptom onset or infection date, but also several days before the \acrshort{rki} is aware of the case. Thus, there are several dates of interest, ordered roughly by occurrence: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item the date of infection, 
    \item the date of symptom onset (if the occurs), 
    \item the date of reporting to the local health authorities,
    \item the date of reporting to the \acrshort{rki} and potentially,
    \item the date of death.
\end{itemize}
Exceptions to this order include the possibility that the date of death could occur before any of the two reporting dates and symptom onset could begin only after the first date of reporting, i.e. because testing is due to contact tracing.

The date of infection is generally unknown. While the date of symptom onset is close to the date of infection, unfortunately, it is only known for roughly $25\%$ of the reported cases. Therefore, we restrict our analyses to the date of reporting. \citep{AnDerHeiden2020Schatzung} use multiple imputation to address this problem; however, this method assumes that the symptom onset dates are missing completely at random, which is questionable as asymptomatic infections will produce no date of symptom onset. There can be considerable delay between the two reporting dates, as we will explore later, see, e.g., \Cref{fig:reporting_delays_cases,fig:survival_function_rep_tri_incidences}.

We restrict ourselves to data available from April 1st, 2020. This dataset already includes cases with earlier reporting date. Additionally, we consider only data reported up to and including May 5th 2023, the date when the WHO declared \acrshort{c19} no longer a global health emergency. \Cref{fig:cases_germany} shows the number of daily reported cases (\textbf{A}) and deaths (\textbf{B}) with a weekly running mean. Apparent from this figure is the considerable day-to-day variation, the so-called weekday effect. As the reporting date is tied to the working hours of the local health authorities, fewer cases are processed, and thus reported, on weekends and more during the week. The weekday effect is less pronounced for the symptom onset date, if it is known (figure not shown). 

We want to highlight two periods of irregularities during the early stage of the epidemic, magnified in \Cref{fig:cases_germany} \textbf{A}. The first concerns a local outbreak in a German meat processing plant \citep{Gunther2020SARSCoV2}. Over two weeks in early June, $1\,413$ positive cases were reported for GÃ¼tersloh county. Due to the low number of reported cases everywhere else, this locally confined outbreak is visible even when aggregating over all counties in Germany. \todo{ref this later}
The second period concerns the Christmas holiday break, where we observe a sudden decline in reported cases, compensated by a large influx in cases in the second week of January. Due to the holiday leave, we'd expect this drop in cases to be related to fewer staff working at the local health authorities, rather than a true decrease in cases. Similar patterns are visible for easter 2021 and Christmas 2021.

% focus on Meldedatum over Infektionsdatum due to consistency issues
Due to late reporting and other reporting artifacts, the number of reported cases for any day $s$ will, usually, increase over time. The \acrshort{rki} does not report incidences on the same day and so on any day $t > s$ we obtain incidences $I_{s,t}$ for day $s$. We say these cases are reported with delay $\tau = t -s > 0$. This results in the so-called reporting triangle, depicted for April 2020 in \Cref{fig:reporting_delays_cases} \textbf{A}. 

\begin{figure}
    \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{%
        \input{tikz/reporting_delays_cases.tex}%
    }
    \caption{\textbf{A}: The reporting triangle for \acrshort{c19} cases in December 2021. Notice that due to late reporting the number of reported cases stabilizes only after roughly $4$ days. \textbf{B}: The reporting triangle for \acrshort{c19} hospitalizations in December 2021. Notice that delays are much longer than those of cases, as it takes weeks to become hospitalized from infection.}
    \label{fig:reporting_delays_cases}
\end{figure}

To quantify the amount of reporting delay, we will focus on the number of newly reported cases on each day, i.e. we want to determine
$$
    I_{s,t} = \sum_{\tau = 1}^{t - s} i_{s,\tau},
$$
where $i_{s,\tau} \in \gls{sym:N0}$ is the number of newly reported cases for day $s$ with delay $\tau$, i.e. on day $t = s + \tau$. However, due to reporting artifacts, it may occur that $i_{s,\tau}$ is negative in some instances, e.g. because the reporting dates of cases have been misattributed. To deal with this issue, we set 
$$
    \tilde I_{s,t} = \min \{\max \{I_{s,s + 1}, \dots, I_{s, t}\}, I_{s, T}\},
$$
where $T$ is the last date in our dataset, i.e. 13th October 2023. This running maximum, cut-off at the final value, ensures that we can write 
$$
    \tilde I_{s,t} =  \sum_{\tau = 1}^{t - s} i_{s,\tau},
$$
where $i_{s,\tau} \in \N_0$. Cutting off at $I_{s,T}$ ensures that if a large amount of cases is misattributed, we still treat the last reported value as the truth. Large positive relative differences $ \frac{I_{s, t} - I_{s,T}}{I_{s,T}} > 0$, possibly due to such misattributions, are quite rare, with the $99.9\%$ quantile of these positive relative differences still being only $16\%$.

From \Cref{fig:reporting_delays_cases} we get the impression that most reporting delays of cases are on the order of days rather than weeks, and indeed this is the case. For day $s$, let
$$
    p_{s,\tau} = \frac{i_{s,\tau}}{\sum_{\tau' = 1}^\infty i_{s,s + \tau'}}
$$
be the proportion of cases that are reported with delay $\tau \in\N$. The corresponding empirical survival function 
$$
    \hat S_{s}(\tau) = 1 - \sum_{\tau' \leq \tau} p_{s,\tau'}
$$
is the share of cases reported with at most $\tau$ days of delay. We compute $\hat S_s(\tau)$ for each day present in the dataset. \Cref{fig:survival_function_rep_tri_incidences} \textbf{A} shows box plots of $\hat S_{s}(\tau)$ for each delay. We observe that the upper quartile of $\hat S_s(4)$ is already below $5\%$, while the upper quartile of $\hat S_s(10)$ is close to $1\%$. 

Additionally, we estimate 
$$
    \hat S_{q}(\tau) = \frac{\sum_{s \in q} i_{s,s + \tau}}{\sum_{s \in q, \tau' \geq 1} i_{s, s+ \tau'}}
$$
for each $q$ of the $15$ quarters present in our dataset separately, as the reporting behavior may have changed over time. Here $s\in q$ means that the day $s$ lies in the quarter $q$. The results are shown in \Cref{fig:survival_function_rep_tri_incidences} \textbf{B}, where we observe that for most quarters, $95\%$ of the cases have been reported after $4$ days delay and $99\%$ of the cases have been reported after $8$ days delay. 
Furthermore, we see that the amount of next-day ($\tau = 1$) reporting slightly decreased in $2021$ and $2022$, compared to the beginning of the pandemic.

\begin{figure}
    \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{%
        \input{tikz/survival_function_rep_tri_incidences.tex}%
    }
    \caption{\textbf{A}: Box plots for the empirical survival function $\hat S_{s}(\tau)$ for all days $s$ in the dataset, after $4$ ($10$) days, the upper quartile of $\hat S_{s}$ is close to $5\%$ ($1\%$).\textbf{B}: Empirical survival function $\hat S(\tau)$ for every quarter present in the \acrshort{c19} dataset. In most quarters $95\%$ ($99\%$) of the cases have been reported after $4$ ($8$) days of delay.}
    \label{fig:survival_function_rep_tri_incidences}
\end{figure}

Reporting delays and artifacts are not the only obstacles we have to overcome when analyzing these data. By definition, the number of reported cases consists of cases with a positive PCR test. To compare reported incidences between two points in time, one has to assume that the so-called dark figure, i.e. the ratio of undetected to detected cases, is the same. However, there is little reason to believe this to be the case: the capacity and total number of PCR tests per week, as well as the ratio of positive tests, has been changing throughout the whole epidemic, see e.g. \citep{Willrich2021Update}. Additionally, the wide-spread availability of rapidtests, and the 2G and 3G \acrshortpl{npi} introduced in fall 2021 likely changed the characteristics of those still getting PCR tests.

In summary, we see that handling case data turns out to be quite involved: we have to account for reporting artifacts, delays and keep in mind, that the reported number of cases is not the same as the actual number of cases. 

\subsection{Hospitalization data}
In addition to reported cases and deaths, starting  April 2021 the \acrshort{rki} publishes the number of hospitalizations of reported \acrshort{c19} cases each day on Zenodo \citep{RobertKoch-Institut2024COVID19Hospitalisierungen} and GitHub \citep{RobertKoch-Institut2024COVID19Hospitalisierungena}. 
Similar to incident cases, weekly hospitalizations are reported by federal state and age group (00-04, 05-14, 15-34, 35-59, 60-79, 80+ and unknown, same as for cases). However, hospitalizations are not reported on the county level, and are only available as weekly rolling sums.

In these data, the number of hospitalizations is linked to the date of reporting of the associated case, so the ``true'' value of the indicator for today, which will only be observed after a long delay, i.e. after the last hospitalization associated with today is reported. While this association requires a careful interpretation of the indicator (see \Cref{sec:nowcasting_hospitalizations}) it was, besides case incidences and ICU occupancy, one of the main official indicators in Germany informing countermeasures in 2021.

The extent of delays is visible in the reporting triangle \Cref{fig:reporting_delays_cases} \textbf{B}: the reported number of hospitalizations on December 1st 2021 roughly doubled over the course of one month. By the aforementioned reporting scheme of hospitalizations, there are two reporting dates for a single hospitalized case: the reporting date of the case --- the date when local health authorities were made aware of the positive test --- and the reporting date of the hospitalization --- the date when the hospitalization was reported to the \acrshort{rki}. This induces a double weekday effect in the reporting delays which we make visible in \Cref{fig:double_weekday_effect_hosp}. 
In this figure, we can observe that the increment $h_{s,\tau}$ --- defined similarly to $i_{s,\tau}$ --- exhibits a weekday effect for both fixed delay $\tau$ and fixed date of hospitalization
$s + \tau$. 

\begin{figure}
    \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{%
        \input{tikz/double_weekday_effect_hosp.tex}%
    }
    \caption{\textbf{A}: the newly reported hospitalizations on days $s$ in December 2021, by delay $\tau$. Notice the double weekday effect in both $s$ and $s+\tau$.\textbf{B}: newly reported hospitalizations during December 2021. The double weekday effect is visible in the striped pattern. \textbf{C}: empirical survival function of hospitalization delays for cases with case reporting date December 1st 2021 with vertical dashed lines indicating four-week increments.}
    \label{fig:double_weekday_effect_hosp}
\end{figure}

Hospitalizations are associated with the \emph{reporting date of the corresponding case} and no information is available on the actual date of hospitalization. In addition, hospitalizations are published only as weekly sums over the past seven days. This means that the number of hospitalizations reported for today consists of all hospitalizations that correspond to cases with a \emph{case reporting date} in the past seven days. In particular, if the case reporting date of a hospitalized case is today, the case will \emph{not} count towards today's hospitalization count. The reporting date of hospitalization is not available in the dataset but can be inferred by comparing datasets from consecutive days.

We show the empirical survival function of hospitalizations for a fixed date in \Cref{fig:double_weekday_effect_hosp} \textbf{C}, split by age groups. We observe that delays have long tails, with most cases reported after 12 weeks (84 days). After such a long delay between infection and hospitalization, it is unlikely that hospitalization is due to the original infection with \acrshort{c19} and will disregard all longer delays in our analyses accordingly. 

As is apparent from these data quality issues, the models we construct will have to account for, e.g. the weekday effect and reporting delays, to make sensible inferences about the true state of the epidemic.
