\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\Acrfull{vmm}}{Variance Minimization method}}
As we have discussed above, the second moment 
$$
\rho = \G [w^{2}]
$$
plays an important role in the performance of importance sampling. Naturally, we may want to choose $\G$ such that $\rho$ becomes minimal. To this end we consider tractable, parametric proposals $\left( \G_{\psi} \right)_{\psi \in \Psi}$ for a parameter set $\Psi$, where usually $\Psi \subseteq \R^{k}$. Noticing that $\G_{\psi} w_{\psi} = 1$, we see that minimizing $\rho_{\psi} = \G_{\psi}[w^{2}_\psi]$ over $\Psi$ is equivalent to minimizing
$$
\var \left( w_{\psi}(X_{\psi}) \right) = \G_{\psi}[w_{\psi}^2] - \G_{\psi}[w_{\psi}]^{2} = \rho_{\psi} - 1,
$$
over $\Psi$ where $X_{\psi} \sim \G_{\psi}$. This is the \gls{vmm}
