\section{Available data and its quality}
\label{sec:data}

Early during the \acrshort{c19} epidemic, a surprising amount of publicly accessible data on the severity became available quickly. These data were provided by national health authorities such as the \acrfull{rki} in Germany, but also made available through aggregate data repositories, e.g. by the \acrfull{jhu} \citep{Dong2020Interactive}. These data contain information about the number of cases and deaths reported each day and depending on the data source further information, e.g., the age, sex or location of the case may be included. Here we focus on the data available for Germany, provided by the \acrshort{rki} \citep{RobertKoch-Institut2022SARSCoV2}. 

In Germany, the reporting process of these cases is regulated by law.

\begin{itemize}
    \item surprising amount of data available, but quality questionable, 
    \item in Germany have data on reported cases and deaths by gender, age group, county, with reporting date of case and for some cases even date of symptom onset
    \item reporting of cases is regulated by Infektionsschutzgesetz
    \item parallel dataset for reports of hospitalisations 
    \item have description section from Nowcasting draft here
    \item descriptive statistics of German COVID-19 data set
    \item even larger datasets that compile this for europe + EFTA (?) by ECDC or by world (JHU)
    \item quality of reported case data is potentially too low 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item reporting delays
        \item weeakday effects
        \item testing regime changing (2G/3G)
        \item ...
    \end{itemize}
    %\item data on commuting
