\section{Available data and its quality}
\label{sec:data}

\begin{itemize}
    \item surprising amount of data available, but quality questionable, 
    \item in Germany have data on reported cases and deaths by gender, age group, county, with reporting date of case and for some cases even date of symptom onset
    \item reporting of cases is regulated by Infektionsschutzgesetz
    \item parallel dataset for reports of hospitalisations 
    \item have description section from Nowcasting draft here
    \item descriptive statistics of German COVID-19 data set
    \item even larger datasets that compile this for europe + EFTA (?) by ECDC or by world (JHU)
    \item quality of reported case data is potentially too low 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item reporting delays
        \item weeakday effects
        \item testing regime changing (2G/3G)
        \item ...
    \end{itemize}
    \item data on commuting
\end{itemize}
