    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains the code and latex files to build my PhD thesis. The code heavily relies on my package [isssm](https://stefanheyder.github.io/isssm), extending it to non-standard use-cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the most recent version of my thesis [here](https://stefanheyder.github.io/dissertation/thesis.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is developed in Jupyter notebooks and organized by the chapters and sections of the thesis. Simulations and analyses are run with `Python`, figures are created with `R`, using `ggplot` and `tikzDevice` to create `tikz` graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reproducibility \n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses the Python package manager [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). To run the code in Python Jupter notebooks, run the following commands\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# install uv\n",
    "curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n",
    "\n",
    "uv sync\n",
    "```\n",
    "This creates a Python virtual environment under `.venv`. Use this virtual environment in all Jupyter notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "For reproducibility of R code, this package uses [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html). Install `renv` and run \n",
    "```r\n",
    "renv::restore()\n",
    "```\n",
    "to install packages necessary to re-create the figures.\n",
