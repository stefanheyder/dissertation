To fit the model for all age groups, we use at most 100 iterations for all occurences of the \acrshort{la}, with a convergence threshold set to $10^{-5}$ relative difference in $z$ and $\Omega$. We use the same method for \acrshort{eis}, where we additionally use $1,000$ samples to determine the optimal proposal, starting with the proposal given by th \acrshort{la}.

For \acrshort{mle}, we use $1,000$ samples to determine the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters, initializing at the initial guess given by \Cref{alg:mle}.

To obtain prediction intervals of the states, signals and missing observations we use $10,000$ samples. To estimate the \acrshort{ess} we use $10,000$ samples.
