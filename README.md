# Introduction

This repository contains the code and latex files to build my PhD
thesis. The code heavily relies on my package
[isssm](https://stefanheyder.github.io/isssm), extending it to
non-standard use-cases.

You can find the most recent version of my thesis
[here](https://stefanheyder.github.io/dissertation/thesis.pdf).

The code is developed in Jupyter notebooks and organized by the chapters
and sections of the thesis. Simulations and analyses are run with
`Python`, figures are created with `R`, using `ggplot` and `tikzDevice`
to create `tikz` graphics.

## Reproducibility

This project uses the Python package manager
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). To run the code in Python Jupter
notebooks, run the following commands

``` bash
# install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

uv sync
```

This creates a Python virtual environment under `.venv`. Use this
virtual environment in all Jupyter notebooks.

For reproducibility of R code, this package uses
[`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html). Install
`renv` and run

``` r
renv::restore()
```

to install packages necessary to re-create the figures.
