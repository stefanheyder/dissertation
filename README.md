## README

This repository contains the code and latex files to build my PhD
thesis. The code heavily relies on my package
[isssm](https://stefanheyder.github.io/isssm), extending it to
non-standard use-cases.

You can find the most recent version of my thesis under the following
link: https://stefanheyder.github.io/dissertation/thesis.pdf.

The code is developed in Jupyter notebooks and organized by the chapters
and sections of the thesis. Simulations and analyses are run with
`Python`, figures are created with `R`, using `ggplot` and `tikzDevice`
to create `tikz` graphics.
