  abstract = {Disease modelling has had considerable policy impact during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and it is increasingly acknowledged that combining multiple models can improve the reliability of outputs. Here we report insights from ten weeks of collaborative short-term forecasting of COVID-19 in Germany and Poland (12 October–19 December 2020). The study period covers the onset of the second wave in both countries, with tightening non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and subsequently a decay (Poland) or plateau and renewed increase (Germany) in reported cases. Thirteen independent teams provided probabilistic real-time forecasts of COVID-19 cases and deaths. These were reported for lead times of one to four weeks, with evaluation focused on one- and two-week horizons, which are less affected by changing NPIs. Heterogeneity between forecasts was considerable both in terms of point predictions and forecast spread. Ensemble forecasts showed good relative performance, in particular in terms of coverage, but did not clearly dominate single-model predictions. The study was preregistered and will be followed up in future phases of the pandemic.},

  abstract = {In the last year many public health decisions were based on real-time monitoring the spread of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. For this one often considers the reproduction number which measures the amount of secondary cases produced by a single infectious individual. While estimates of this quantity are readily available on the national level, subnational estimates, e.g. on the county level, pose more difficulties since only few incidences occur there. However, as countermeasures to the pandemic are usually enforced on the subnational level, such estimates are of great interest to assess the efficacy of the measures taken, and to guide future policy. We present a novel extension of the well established estimator of the country level reproduction number to the county level by applying techniques from small-area estimation. This new estimator yields sensible estimates of reproduction numbers both on the country and county level. It can handle low and highly variable case counts on the county level, and may be used to distinguish local outbreaks from more widespread ones. We demonstrate the capabilities of our novel estimator by a simulation study and by applying the estimator to German case data.},

  abstract = {Most countries have started vaccinating people against COVID-19. However, due to limited production capacities and logistical challenges it will take months/years until herd immunity is achieved. Therefore, vaccination and social distancing have to be coordinated. In this paper, we provide some insight on this topic using optimization-based control on an age-differentiated compartmental model. For real-life decision-making, we investigate the impact of the planning horizon on the optimal vaccination/social distancing strategy. We find that in order to reduce social distancing in the long run, without overburdening the health care system, it is essential to vaccinate the people with the highest contact rates first. That is also the case if the objective is to minimize fatalities provided that the social distancing measures are sufficiently strict. However, for short-term planning it is optimal to focus on the high-risk group.},

We provide object-oriented and extensively unit-tested implementations. Manifolds come equipped with families of Riemannian metrics with associated exponential and logarithmic maps, geodesics, and parallel transport. Statistics and learning algorithms provide methods for estimation, clustering, and dimension reduction on manifolds. All associated operations are vectorized for batch computation and provide support for different execution backends---namely NumPy, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. This paper presents the package, compares it with related libraries, and provides relevant code examples. We show that Geomstats provides reliable building blocks to both foster research in differential geometry and statistics and democratize the use of Riemannian geometry in machine learning applications.

  abstract = {Abstract                        Background             Short-term forecasts of infectious disease burden can contribute to                         situational awareness and aid capacity planning. Based on best practice in                         other fields and recent insights in infectious disease epidemiology, one can                         maximise the predictive performance of such forecasts if multiple models are                         combined into an ensemble. Here we report on the performance of ensembles in                         predicting COVID-19 cases and deaths across Europe between 08 March 2021 and                         07 March 2022.                                   Methods             We used open-source tools to develop a public European COVID-19 Forecast                         Hub. We invited groups globally to contribute weekly forecasts for COVID-19                         cases and deaths reported from a standardised source over the next one to                         four weeks. Teams submitted forecasts from March 2021 using standardised                         quantiles of the predictive distribution. Each week we created an ensemble                         forecast, where each predictive quantile was calculated as the                         equally-weighted average (initially the mean and then from 26th July the                         median) of all individual models’ predictive quantiles. We measured the                         performance of each model using the relative Weighted Interval Score (WIS),                         comparing models’ forecast accuracy relative to all other models. We                         retrospectively explored alternative methods for ensemble forecasts,                         including weighted averages based on models’ past predictive                         performance.                                   Results             Over 52 weeks we collected and combined up to 28 forecast models for 32                         countries. We found a weekly ensemble had a consistently strong performance                         across countries over time. Across all horizons and locations, the ensemble                         performed better on relative WIS than 84\% of participating models’ forecasts                         of incident cases (with a total N=862), and 92\% of participating models’                         forecasts of deaths (N=746). Across a one to four week time horizon,                         ensemble performance declined with longer forecast periods when forecasting                         cases, but remained stable over four weeks for incident death forecasts. In                         every forecast across 32 countries, the ensemble outperformed most                         contributing models when forecasting either cases or deaths, frequently                         outperforming all of its individual component models. Among several choices                         of ensemble methods we found that the most influential and best choice was                         to use a median average of models instead of using the mean, regardless of                         methods of weighting component forecast models.                                   Conclusions             Our results support the use of combining forecasts from individual                         models into an ensemble in order to improve predictive performance across                         epidemiological targets and populations during infectious disease epidemics.                         Our findings further suggest that median ensemble methods yield better                         predictive performance more than ones based on means. Our findings also                         highlight that forecast consumers should place more weight on incident death                         forecasts than incident case forecasts at forecast horizons greater than two                         weeks.
