\chapter*{Publications and Contributions}

This thesis consists of mostly unpublished work. 
During my time as a PhD student I have, however, been fortunate to collarborate with many scientists on problems in mathematical epidemiology with a focus on COVID-19, which resulted in several publications.
In this section I want to clarify what my contributions to these publications were and which contributions of the present thesis are new.
